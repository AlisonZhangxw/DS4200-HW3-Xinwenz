                    Hi, My name's Xinwen Zhang, and I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in 
                    Data Science and Mathematics at Northeastern University. I'm now a student who’s currently 
                    exploring Information Visualization. It’s one of the most fascinating courses I’ve taken so far. 
                    The instructor explains concepts clearly and brings data to life through stories and visuals, 
                    which makes every class feel inspiring and engaging. I’ve really grown to love this field 
                    because it connects creativity with analytical thinking.
               </p>
               <p>
                    Outside of academics, I love staying active — swimming, skiing, and doing Pilates are my favorite ways 
                    to unwind and keep my body moving. But sometimes, I’m also that lazy person who spends an entire day 
                    eating my favorite food and watching random videos online. I think that’s what makes life balanced — 
                    a mix of discipline and indulgence.
               </p>
               <p>
                    When I’m not studying or exercising, I like watching Korean dramas and anime on Netflix. 
                    I also enjoy listening to music every day — it helps me relax and stay positive. 
                    Cause I always need some sound around me, so I play music even when I’m alone at home. 
                    I have speakers in my living room, bedroom, and even the bathroom, 
                    so I can hear clear music wherever I go. Music makes my life feel full and alive.
               </p>
               <p>
                    I’m an INFP and an Aquarius, which probably explains my imaginative side 
                    and my constant desire to find meaning in everything I do. I enjoy creative work, deep conversations, 
                    and learning about people and ideas that challenge the way I see the world. I hope this website gives 
                    you a small glimpse into who I am.
               </p>
